    <h2 id="sec1" class="about_tool">About Article Rewriter</h2>
    <p>
    <p>This&nbsp;Article Rewriter is a free, automatic&nbsp;rewriter that will rewrite any given text into its <i>synonymical</i>&nbsp;readable text. To use this Article Rewriter, type or copy and paste your content into the text box above, and then click on the &lsquo;Submit&rsquo; button.</p>

<h2>CONTENT IS NECESSARY, BUT NOT CHEAP</h2>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever tried to create content on a regular basis, maybe for your blog or newsletter, you might have an idea of how difficult it could be to produce high-quality articles frequently. It&#39;s usually time-consuming, effort-intensive, and requires top-level expertise including a good command of the English language.</p>

<p>Yet, content is just so necessary if your online business must go places.</p>

<p>Of course, writing your content by hand, sentence-by-sentence is the surest way to ensure quality and plagiarism-free work , but that usually isn&#39;t easy, especially if you are looking for quality results.</p>

<p>One way to deal with this is to hire a professional freelance writer to help you with your content needs. But again, hiring a pro writer isn&#39;t cheap at all.</p>

<p>So what should you do? Well, a much cheaper and quicker approach is to use an online rephrase tool.</p>

<h2>WHAT IS AN ARTICLE REWRITER AND HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>

<p>This tool (also known as Text Spinner or Paraphrase Online) is a piece of automated software technology used for rewriting text (such as a blog post) so that the overall message and meaning of the original content are left intact while the wording is changed significantly.</p>

<p>It works by technically reading and understanding the text that you enter and then rewriting it to produce a different, readable version of the spun content.</p>

<p>It is commonly used by content creators, website administrators, bloggers, and marketing agencies in an attempt to imitate the success of existing content while appearing original.</p>

<p>Accordingly, &ldquo;content spinning&rdquo; refers to this process of rewriting an article with the above explained purpose in mind.</p>

<h2>BENEFITS OF USING AN ARTICLE SPINNER</h2>

<p>There are numerous benefits associated with using an article rewrite tool. Here are some:</p>

<ol>
	<li>It&#39;s a great time-saver: Usually, it takes hours or even days to manually create a human-readable content. But with an online rephrase tool, you can rewrite an article in just a few minutes.</li>
	<li>It increases efficiency: You can produce a large amount of articles within a short time period, thereby improving productivity.</li>
	<li>It lets you have content whenever you want: An online rephraser tool serves as your &ldquo;always-on-duty&rdquo; content producer, giving you lots of content anytime you want.</li>
	<li>It lets you do SEO better: You get to run better search engine optimization (SEO) as you can power your campaigns abundantly with the content produced from an paraphrase online tool.</li>
	<li>It augments your skills: If your English language or writing skills are not that good, you can depend on an article spinning tool or sentence rewriter to serve as your aid.</li>
</ol>

<h2>PARAPHRASING TOOL BY SMALLSEOTOOLS: THE BEST ARTICLE SPINNER</h2>

<p>If you&#39;ve read the sections above, by now you should have an idea of what an sentence rewriter is, how it works, and why you should use one.</p>

<p>But with the market being saturated with lots of spinners, which paragraph rewriter tool should you use?</p>

<p>Well, you don&#39;t have to look any further because Small SEO Tools has got your back.</p>

<p>This lets you spin quality, readable content in no time.</p>

<p>We are not talking about wasting your time manually rewriting spintax, but a situation where you still hold the actual authority while the tool does all the hard work for you in a trustworthy way.</p>

<h2>WHY CHOOSE SENTENCE REWRITER SMALLSEOTOOLS?</h2>

<p>There are so many reasons to use our Sentence spinner tool.</p>

<ul>
	<li>This tool by Small SEO Tools is built for simplicity. It can actually pass for the simplest paraphrasing tool you&#39;ll ever come across. You don&#39;t need a whole lot of inputs to use it other than your written text. In fact, you don&#39;t even have to register to use it.</li>
	<li>No prior expertise is required to use this paraphrasing tool. Since it is extremely simple, anyone with a little technical know-how can use it without any complications.</li>
	<li>Some article spinners out there require you to enter your text with properly formatted spintax to create the end result. To create formatted spintax, you&#39;ll usually need another tool. But&nbsp;<a data-name="1-sst" href="https://smallseotools.com/article-rewriter/">Article Rewriter</a>&nbsp;by Small SEO Tools doesn&#39;t require that. Instead, it does all the thinking for you, from taking in the context of every phrase to creating additional textual content that is as readable and meaningful as the text you originally entered.</li>
	<li>Our free article changer tool can be a vital tool for anyone who wants to market their website or product online as quickly and efficiently as possible as you&#39;ll be able to quickly create all the unique, quality textual content you will ever want for building legitimate web visibility.</li>
	<li>This free spins/paraphrase online tool can deliver reliable results both in terms of human readership and search engine exposure. This means, with our text rewriting tool, you&#39;ll be able to continually update your blog, social media pages, and website with fresh content. Note that we not talking about content that will get you penalized by Google or content that looks like machine written gibberish. But an automatically generated high-quality content that your readers and Google actually loves.</li>
	<li>Our tool does not spit out spintax formatted results, nor does it require you to enter spintax to create rewritten content. All you need to do is enter human readable text and you will get human readable text out. Simple, right?</li>
</ul>

<h2>HOW TO USE SENTENCE REWRITER BY SMALLSEOTOOLS</h2>

<p>Using our article rewriting tool is pretty easy. Below are the steps to take:</p>

<p><strong>Step #1:</strong>&nbsp;Go to&nbsp;<a data-name="1-sst" href="https://smallseotools.com/article-rewriter/">https://smallseotools.com/article-Rewriter/</a></p>

<p><strong>Step #2:</strong>&nbsp;On the box provided, paste your content. You also have the option of uploading a document in .doc, .docx, and .txt formats, as well as uploading directly from either Google Drive or Dropbox.</p>

<p><strong>Step #3:</strong>&nbsp;Click on the &ldquo;Re-write Article&rdquo; button to run it. It&#39;ll take a few seconds to generate suggestions/synonyms based on the wordings of your pasted content.</p>

<p><strong>Step #4:</strong>&nbsp;After the engine has spun the article, it&#39;ll show you the suggested edits in bold and colored text.</p>

<p><strong>Step #5:</strong>&nbsp;If you&#39;re happy with the final result, click on &ldquo;Next&rdquo; to flatten it. If not, you can click on &ldquo;Rephrase Again&rdquo; to spin a different version of the content with a different set of synonyms.</p>

<p>NOTE: The way our article rewriter works is that it scan your content for words that can be replaced with a synonym. All the words that it replaces with an alternate option are highlighted in bold and colorful text. You can click on any suggested word to revert to the original word, find other suggested words, or add your own custom word.</p>

<p>We recommend that you proofread the content created by this sentence changer to see if there are things to change before putting it to use.</p>

<h2>HOW TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF WORD SPINNER.</h2>

<p>Here are some cues to help you make the best use of this free article spinner, especially per search engine optimization purposes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Start with a quality article. This means a unique topic or viewpoint on a very specific topic. The information must be valuable to a human reader. At this point in time, it is not possible for any software program to produce content that is engaging. If you start out with a low-quality article, the chances are high that the alternate versions are going to be even worse.</li>
	<li>Read through the rewritten article personally. Does it make sense? You may catch several suggested words that don&rsquo;t fit into the context. If you feel it doesn&#39;t read well, click &ldquo;Rephrase Again&rdquo; for a new version. If none of the alternate words fit, try changing the original word to trigger new suggestions.</li>
	<li>We recommend running the final results &mdash; when you&rsquo;re satisfied &mdash; through our Plagiarism Checker tool just to verify it is unique enough to pass the plagiarism test used by search engines before you publish it on the web.</li>
	<li>To avoid spamming, we do not recommend using this tool to produce multiple versions of the same article. Not only is this penalized by search engines, but it offers nothing of value to your target audience either.</li>
</ul>    </p> <br />
